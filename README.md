# Color Pallete

Color plays one of the most important roles in the design of Stack. It is not only the expression of style, but rather it’s used to communicate the meaning.

In the upcoming version of Stack, users will be able to personalize their Spaces individually with custom color themes

(Space is the collection of cards grouped by meaning. Work, Personal Finance, Shopping, etc.)

In order to achieve consistency in the design, we would like to create a library that generates various color palettes based on the input colors.(such as background color, accent color, etc)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

- Install all the dependcies for the app.

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- Enter the `Background` and `Accent` HEX code into the input field.

- Click the `Generate Shades` button to generate the all shaded for background and accent as well below.

- The 10 different shades are generated from dark to light for background and accent.

- If you hover it shades below, so there is a `Copy` icon visible.

- If you click on `Copy` icon to copy the exact Hex-code for that color

- Click the `Reset` button to use it again and generate new shades.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
