# Color Pallete

Color plays one of the most important roles in the design of Stack. It is not only the expression of style, but rather itâ€™s used to communicate the meaning.

In the upcoming version of Stack, users will be able to personalize their Spaces individually with custom color themes

(Space is the collection of cards grouped by meaning. Work, Personal Finance, Shopping, etc.)

In order to achieve consistency in the design, we would like to create a library that generates various color palettes based on the input colors.(such as background color, accent color, etc)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the app in the development mode.\

- The 10 different shades are generated from dark to light for background and accent.

- If you hover it shades below, so there is a `Copy` icon visible.
